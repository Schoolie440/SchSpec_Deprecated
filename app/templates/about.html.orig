			Even at young age, Brian was a tinkerer. From playing with Legos, making automatic rubber band shooters with his K'nex set, or building ziplines in our barn, 
			Brian has always been working on something. Now, Brian's projects are a little bigger, but his passion for design has only grown. As a senior in college, he designed a prosthetic leg for a young boy 
			who was a friend of the family; the new leg allowed the boy to ride a bicycle for the first time.

			<p>
			Brian Schoolcraft has a bachelor's degree from Purdue University in Mechanical Engineering, and he is currently employed as an advanced design engineer
			at Allison Transmission. He and his wife, Amanda, enjoy tending llamas, runner ducks, guineas, peacocks, a great dane, and even a parrot at their home in rural Indiana. In his spare time, 
			Brian has slowly amassed the beginnings of a solid machine shop, including a mid-sized lathe with an in-house designed digital read out and a project mill that he has 
			been repairing by fabricating the parts for it in his garage.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Beyond engineering, Brian serves his community through various facets including volunteering and leading small groups at his church.
