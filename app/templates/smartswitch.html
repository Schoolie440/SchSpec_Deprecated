				The DL4 Smart Switch gives you the ability to convert quarter notes to dotted eighth notes on any delay setting at any time. On top of that, you
				also get the option to switch quickly between two presets per delay type without the need of an external expression pedal.
				</p>
			
				<p>
				The Smart Switch mod involves installing a new footswitch on the DL4 that is connected to the Smart Switch circuit board inside of the pedal.
				When you tap in quarter notes on the new switch they are converted into dotted eighth notes and sent to the DL4 via the Smart Switch circuit. 
				Another feature, the Double Preset Mod, provides the ability to simulate having an expression pedal plugged into the DL4. By pressing and holding the 
				new footswitch down for about 1 second, the Smart Switch circuit will simulate you moving the expression pedal from the heel down position to the toe down 
				position or vice-versa. This allows you to have two different presets per delay type. See the <a href="{{url_for('smartswitch')}}#modinfo">Mod Info</a> section below for more information.
				</p>
				<p><strong class="text-danger">Please Note:</strong> There will be a waiting list. I make parts/PCB orders in batches of 6. I will wait for 6 orders to come in
				before I place a parts order. After the parts are in, I'll ask for payment and then ship you the kit.
				</p>
				<p>
				Check out the Mod Kit and Pricing section to the right for more details on shipping, price, etc. Also, you can download the source code,
				installation manual, and Smart Switch schematic completely for free. Be sure to check out the <a href="{{url_for('smartswitch')}}#demovideos">demo videos</a> below as well. Thanks for your interest in this mod, and best of luck!

		<h3>Mod Details</h3>
		<p>
		The kit comes with a programmed micro-controller, the Smart Switch PCB, the LED breakout board, all the components and 
		instructions necessary to complete the dotted eighth mod, double preset mod, and even the parts and instructions necessary to get rid
		of that nasty volume drop that plagues the DL4. Check out the <a href="{{url_for('smartswitch')}}#skillsrequired">Skills Required</a> section below to 
		see if you have what it takes to do the mod. I also strongly recommend looking through the installation manual <a href="static/doc/SmartSwitchManual v2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
		</p>
		<h3 id="betatesters">Beta Testers</h3>
		<p>
		The first six people to email me at joe@schoolcraftspecialties.com will be able to purchase the mod as a beta tester. What does this mean though? 
		A beta tester gets to buy the mod at a discounted rate (see below). However, I ask that they be prepared to work out a few potential bugs. 
		So far, the several mods that I have performed have operated correctly and without defect, but I'd like to leave some wiggle room and hear some 
		feedback from the first of you who have decided to take the leap and attempt the mod on your own. So, in a nutshell:
		<ul>
			<li>Be prepared to have issues with the mod</li>
			<li>Agree to contact me if you have issues so we can work through them</li>
			<li>If you have suggestions, please let me know as well</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As a beta tester you will benefit from:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A 50% discount on the mod</li>
			<li>Being among the first to have a DL4 with the Smart Switch</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Like I've said, I've done three mods with this system with minimal problems. All of them have gone smoothly so I'm not expecting many hangups to 
		appear. The biggest issue I can foresee is the directions that I printed up not being clear enough. After I ship out the beta tester boards, I'll 
		make adjustments as per their suggestions and order a bigger batch of PCBs so I can start selling to everyone. 
		Anyway, I hope you are all interested in this mod still. I'm excited about getting it to you guys! 
		</p>
		<h3 id="skillsrequired">Skills Required</h3>
		<p>
		To install this kit, you should have experience with a soldering iron. It would be beneficial
		if you have done some tinkering on pedals before too. This is a bit of an in depth mod; it includes a lot of soldering and drilling a few holes in your case.
		If you don't feel comfortable doing it, maybe wait and see what other people say about the mod before attempting it. It'd be a shame to destroy a $200.00 pedal over a 
		$50.00 modification.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, it is very important that you read and understand the disclaimer/agreement below.
		</p>
