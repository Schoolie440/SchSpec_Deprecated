      <p>
	  We're three brothers that were raised in the country south of Indianapolis by a couple of engineers. Growing up together in a rural environment gave us
	  the encouragement that we needed to start doing projects for fun. There weren't that many other kids around, and there definitely wasn't a bustling 
	  metropolis full of fun things to do anywhere nearby, so we had to come up with ways to avoid boredom on our own. This was quite possibly the best thing
	  that could have happened to us.
	  
	  someone please write more...this is hard. maybe stuff about sports etc.

			<p>
			Even at young age, Brian was a tinkerer. From playing with Legos, making automatic rubber band shooters with his K'nex set, or building ziplines in our barn, 
			Brian has always been working on something. Now, Brian's projects are a little bigger, but his passion for design has only grown. As a senior in college, he designed a prosthetic leg for a young boy 
			who was a friend of the family; the new leg allowed the boy to ride a bicycle for the first time.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Brian Schoolcraft has a bachelor's degree from Purdue University in Mechanical Engineering, and he is currently employed as an advanced design engineer
			at Allison Transmission. He and his wife, Amanda, enjoy tending llamas, runner ducks, guineas, peacocks, a great dane, and even a parrot at their home in rural Indiana. In his spare time, 
			Brian has slowly amassed the beginnings of a solid machine shop, including a mid-sized lathe with an in-house designed digital read out and a project mill that he has 
			been repairing by fabricating the parts for it in his garage.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Beyond engineering, Brian serves his community through various facets including volunteering and leading small groups at his church.

	  Joe's currently at Purdue University studying Acoustical and Electrical Engineering. He's big into music, spending most of his free time honing 
	  his guitar skills and staying sharp on the piano and violin. He puts those talents to use every week as the lead guitarist in our church worship band.</p>
    <p>As a combination of his education and his passion, he's dove headfirst into effects

			<p>Ben is the youngest of the Schoolcraft clan. Currently finishing up his junior year in high school, he's decided to skip town and head to college so he gets an extra year to live with Joe and our sister Amanda in West Lafayette. He's settled on engineering as a major, but the specific discipline is still a little up in the air. With a strong aptitude and a care free attitude, we're looking forward to seeing his role in our little partnership fully develop.</p>
      
      <p>Besides the nerdy stuff, Ben was a state qualifier this year in wrestling, and plays the bass in his church's worship band.</p>
